# Hi, I'm Keanu.

## Welcome
I had a really rough start when I first started coding because a lot of things didn't make sense. I even switched my major out of Computer Science for a semester. But I switched back and now I am focused, and ready to learn more. Ever since I switched back to Computer Science, I grinded and now coding is actually pretty fun. 

## Education
I am currently attending the University of Nevada, Las Vegas as a Computer Science Major. I went to the University of Nevada, Reno for my first two years.
Relevant Coursework: Algorithms, Data Structures, Operating Systems, Compiler Construction, Digital Design, Automata and Formal Languages, Cloud Computing, Building Applications on the Cloud, Software Engineering

Aside from my college classes, I decided to learn some Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and many web frameworks like React and Next.js on my own.
