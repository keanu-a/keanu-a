### 👋🏽 Hey, I'm Keanu

I'm a 23-year-old software engineer based in Las Vegas, recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from UNLV (May 2024).

I love building software that makes a difference — whether that’s helping someone learn, supporting a community, or improving the way an organization runs. I care most about creating things that are **useful, thoughtful, and real**.

Open to anything that helps me grow. Always eager to learn more.
