# Hi, I'm Keanu.

Yes, Keanu like the actor Keanu Reeves.

## About Me
I am just a wandering mind that focuses my attention when I code. When I first started coding, I hated every second of it. 
Now, coding is a lot more fun and a lot more rewarding when everything works at the end. 

## Interest
I have many CS related interests like in web development, backend development, game development, software engineering, and even machine learning.
Non-CS related interests include traveling, eating, going to the gym, and playing piano.

## Education
I am currently attending the University of Nevada, Las Vegas as a Computer Science Major. I went to the University of Nevada, Reno for my first two years.
Relevant Coursework: Intro to Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Digital Design

On the side, I learned basic HTML & CSS, and have good knowledge using Python.

Im currently just looking to finish and complete my Computer Science degree and look for internships before I graduate!
