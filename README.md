# Hi, I'm Keanu.

## My brief CS Journey
I had a really rough start when I first started coding because a lot of things didn't make sense. I even switched my major out of Computer Science for a semester. However, I felt Computer Science was for me so I switched back. I switched mindsets and focused on how all the pieces work together. What really helped was seeing what you could create with code, even if it is really small. Self teaching myself Python helped, since I was able to make video games and make user interfaces compared to the projects made in my college classes. After basically 2 years of Computer Science, I went from being completely clueless with C++ to understanding it tremendously. Furthermore, I went from hating coding, to looking forward to code more. 

## About Me
I have many CS related interests like in web development, backend development, game development, software engineering, and even machine learning.
Non-CS related interests include traveling, eating, cooking, baking, going to the gym, playing piano, and dancing.

## Education
I am currently attending the University of Nevada, Las Vegas as a Computer Science Major. I went to the University of Nevada, Reno for my first two years.
Relevant Coursework: Intro to Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Digital Design, Computer Organization

On the side, I learned very basic HTML & CSS, and have made some projects in Python.
