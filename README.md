# Hi, I'm Keanu.

Yes, Keanu like the actor Keanu Reeves.

## About Me
I am just a wandering mind that focuses my attention when I code. When I first started coding, I hated every second of it. Over time, I put my mind into everything and thought out
what coding should be like rather than just a lot of obstacles.

Now, coding is a lot more fun and a lot more rewarding when everything works at the end. 

## Interest
I have many CS related interests like in web development, backend development, game development, software engineering, and even machine learning.
Non-CS related interests include traveling, eating, going to the gym, and playing piano.

## Education
I am currently sharpening my skills with C++ at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I began my computer science degree at the University of Nevada, Reno where I learned C and C++.
When I transferred, I was taught two assembly languages - x86-68 and MIPS. On the side, I try to teach myself how to write programs in Python and it has been very fun. 

I also tried to code a little bit in HTML and CSS to make a starter website for myself, although nothing amazing.

Im currently just looking to finish and complete my Computer Science degree and look for internships before I graduate!
