### 👋🏽 Hey, I'm Keanu

I'm a 23-year-old software engineer based in Las Vegas, recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from UNLV (May 2024).

I love building software that makes a difference - whether that’s helping someone learn, supporting a community, or improving the way an organization runs. I care most about creating things that are **useful, thoughtful, and real**.

Open to anything that helps me grow. Always eager to learn more.

When I’m not coding, I'm at the gym, playing piano or video games, exploring new food spots, traveling, getting too competitive at board games, or hanging out with my four dogs.
