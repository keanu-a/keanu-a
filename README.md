### 👋🏽 Hey, I'm Keanu

I'm a 23-year-old software engineer based in Las Vegas, recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from UNLV (May 2024). I build things that are useful, fast, and feel good to use.

Right now, I’m working on **Easy Tagalog**, a full-stack app that teaches Tagalog in a Duolingo-style experience.

Outside of tech, you’ll find me at the gym, playing piano, exploring food spots, or hanging out with my 4 dogs.
